================

The project consists of boiler-plate code to help in testing
executables that generate output using stderr and stdout.
It is a very simple way of running executables and 
writing test code against the textual output.

Upon the completion of a run the test code is able to
examine the output of the program through stderr, stdout 
and combined. Exit code can also be tested.
